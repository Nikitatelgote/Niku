                Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was
                an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and political
                leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of
                India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and
                Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal
                Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after
                renouncing Hinduism After graduating from Elphinstone College,
                University of Bombay,
                Ambedkar
                studied economics at Columbia University and the London School
                of
                Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively,
                an was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at
                either
                institution in the 1920s.[3] He also trained in the law at
                Gray's
                Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist,
                professor,
                and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political
                activities;
                he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for
                partition,
                publishing journals, advocating political rights and social
                freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of the
                stat
                In 1990, theBharat Ratna,  The salutation Jai Bhim
                (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also
                referred to by the nickname Babasaheb (BAH-bə SAH-hayb), meaning
                "Respected Father".
                Upon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new prime
                minister Jawaharlal Nehru invited Ambedkar to serve as the
                Dominion of India's Law Minister; two weeks later, he was
                appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution
                for the future Republic of India.

                On 25 November 1949, Ambedkar in his concluding speech in
                constituent assembly said:[66]

                "The credit that is given to me does not really belong to me. It
                belongs partly to Sir B.N. Rau the Constitutional Advisor to the
                Constituent Assembly who prepared a rough draft of the
                Constitution for the consideration of the Drafting Committee."
                Indian constitution guarantees and protections for a wide range
                of civil liberties for individual citizens, including freedom of
                religion, the abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of
                all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar was one of the ministers
                who argued for extensive economic and social rights for women,
                and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of
                reservations of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges
                for members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and Other
                Backward Class, a sys

                Ambedkar expressed his disapproval for the constitution in 1953
                during a parliament session and said "People always keep on
                saying to me "Oh you are the maker of the constitution". My
                answer is I was a hack. What I was asked to do, I did much
                against my will." Ambedkar added that, "I am quite prepared to
                say that I shall be the first person to burn it out. I do not
                want it. It does not suit anybody."[69][70]

                Economics
                Ambedkar was the first Indian to pursue a doctorate in economics
                abroad.[71] He argued that industrialisation and agricultural
                growth could enhance the Indian economy.[72] He stressed
                investment in agriculture as the primary industry of
                India.[citation needed] Ambedkar advocated national economic and
                social development, stressing education, public hygiene,
                community health, residential facilities as the basic
                amenities.[72] His DSc thesis, The problem of the Rupee: Its
                Origin and Solution (1923) examines the causes for t he
                arguedinting of a gold ates and prices.[73]

                He also analysed revenue in his PhD dissertation The Evolution
                of Provincial Finance in British India. In this work, he
                analysed the various systems used by the British colonial
                government to manage finances in India.[73][74] His views on
                finance were that governments should ensure their expenditures
                have "faithfulness, wisdom a in Land Revenue Tax and excise duty
                policies to stabilise the economy.[citation needed] He played an
                important role in land reform and the (higher castes would not
                do lower-caste occupations) and movement of capital (assuming
                investors would invest first in their own caste occupation). His
                theory of State Socialism had three points: state ownership of
                agricultural land, the mai

                Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military
                cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar)
                (now in Madhya Pradesh).[5] He was the 14th and last child of
                Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of
                Subedar, and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.[6]

                Maharashtra.
                Ambedkar was born into a Mahar (dalit) caste, who were
                treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic
                discrimination.[7] Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked
                for the army of the British East India Company,
                and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow
                cantonment.[8] Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other
                untouchable children were segregated and given little attention

                that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch eithe
                the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually
                performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the
                peon was not available then he had to go without water; he
                described the situation later in his writings as "No peon,
                No Water".[9] He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he
                had to take home with him.[10]
